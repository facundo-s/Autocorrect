# Autocorrect
Exemplifies the basics of the autocorrect functionality using tries

The full spec for this project can be found here: http://cs61b.ug/sp15/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html

This project seeks to implement the functionality of autocorrect. Given an input of words and weights representing their frequencies a user can input a string and Autocomplete will return a list of the words that begin with the input string in order of weight. 

Test files and sample inputs can be found in the TestFiles directory. The bulk of the project can be found in TernarySearchTree and Autocorrect.
